This project uses Selenium WebDriver, PyTest, Python, and the POM framework for automating tests on a web app.
It navigates to a URL, tests the Add Customer-form, submits it, and verifies the result.
XPath locators are used for element identification, with Poetry for dependency management, and Git/GitHub for version control.
